Is it similar to what Marx said that quantitative change lead to qualitative change? In my experiments with slime mold with Gus and Wenshu, we found that slime mold, as a kind of amoeba organism, could not only react to certain stitumus but also remember the pattern of stimulus and react preemptively! Is this thrilling? Does this mean the accumulation of percepetions leads to cognition or consciousness?">

Arabic people are fond of repetition, like the language itself, when one says 'Sabah el-khair(Morning with good)' the other replies 'Sabah en-noor(Morning with health)', it's like ping-pang, when one thing is generated, some other similar thing is followed. The same philosophy could be found in the islamic star like patterns, like the NYU AD logo, which is consisted with four torches reflected to each other, the interesting thing of this logo is that it could extend, to a infinity surface. So I made a website to draw this kind of repetitive patterns.">

Every face is marked either as beautiful or not beautiful, and the every face has its facial data i.e. landmarks, like the distance between the eyes, or the size of the mouth, there are 52 landmarks every face. Accordingly, I'm using K-Means algorithm to get 10 average faces(which are essentially landmarks data) as perfect face. Then when a new person take a photo and send the image to the python script, a score will be calculated comparing to each of the ten perfect 'face', and the highest one will be the final sore.">

One proud thing during my college years is the viruses-like spreading of this find Lehman game among our NYU Shanghai students. During our freshmen year, every Monday 9:45am, all 300 of the NYU Shanghai students have to attend this core class -- Global Perspective on Society, lectures led by our dear chancellor Lehman, and the class is, I have to admit, soporific...so I made this game for some fun(not during lecture though), and it was even tested by professor Lehman during our IMA final show. The picture is he using the game ending screenshot for attendence.">
