Every time when people walk into the restaurant, a beacon will send the related website to the user, when put the camera at the menu, there will be AR parts revealing, the user can interact with the menu with functions of showing 3D models of dishes, see nutrition lables, order food, and even the see panorama streaming of the how your food is being made. I build a demo in Unity with Vuforia, and streaming 360 video with Ricoh Theta.">

						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBtz_ynLg2I&t=28s" data-largesrc="images/lysense.png" data-title="Lysense" data-description="Lysense is a project for future transportation, it is designed to replace traffic light. The ideal functionality would be achieved by AR wearable devices, as well as a projection mapping/LED make up for non-ar clients. The idea is that there will be safe zone and dangerous zones shown to people through AR instead of traffic lights. Pedestrians' movements are captured by motion sensors and a calculation of safe zones are respectively sent to cars and pedestrians. I built a Unity simulation for a specific circumstance: People don't always obey traffic lights, which is especially dangerous during night, the projection mapping could help during night. Thanks to the very innovative and helpful Professor -- Mitchel Joachim for directing the project, and thanks to NYU Future Reality lab for the sensors and devices, dope place with dope people.">

I spent the summer of 2015 shooting VR documentaries of the old neighbourhoods，and making photogremmetry 3D models of the Shikumen architectures which will soon be demolished and replaced by skyscrapers. I built a Unity simulation with different doors in photogremmetry models leading to different neighbourhoods in 360 videos. This project is selected and supported by Dean's Undergraduate Research Funds. Thanks to my friend David Lin who joined me to make this wonderful project possible.">

There is also a 360 video to showing the processes of doing plasmid miniprep. Thanks to the help of Bruno Kruse, and many thanks to my dear teammates and our instructors. ">

I added face controlling to free the mouse, as well as different effects on hovering different elements, including 3D models, flamming test color or it's common molecular formula. This is the final project for Professor Ken Perlin's Computer Graphic, and thanks to my partner Ziming for the amazing atomic models.">

Whenever I find a harmonic environment, I'll use panorama to record its special beauty, I got more than 1000k views with my panorama selection on google, and I'm a google local guide.">
