# linkshare

A very simple Google Chrome extension. It allows the current tab to be saved as a bookmark list. Optionally, the database of links can be synced with a remote Apache CouchDB, PouchDB or Cloudant database. As several clients can connect to the same database, adhoc groups of users can share the same links.

The following technologies are used:

* [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com) - an in-browser database that syncs with anything that speaks the CouchDB replication protocol
* [Picnic CSS](http://picnicss.com/) - a lightweight CSS library  (16k)
* [ZeptoJS](http://zeptojs.com/) - lightweight alternative to jQuery (25k)
* [Google Chrome Extensions API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index) - gives Chrome extensions access to APIs that normal web apps don't
* [IBM Design Language Icon Library](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/resources/icon-library)

This example isn't designed to be ground-breaking or an exposition of best client-side development practice; there are no frameworks used here, just a single page of HTML and 100 lines of JavaScript.
